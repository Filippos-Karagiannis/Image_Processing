~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ APPLICATION RUNNING GUIDE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Make sure you are in a Windows environment and
have the latest version of .NET Framework installed.

2) To run the program via Visual Studio (version 2019 is recommended)
make sure that the "C++/CLI support for v142 build tools" package is installed
if it is not then navigate to tools->get tools and features
then select the "Desktop Development with C++" package and
select the optional option "C++/CLI support for v142 build tools".
Finally you can click on the "Debug->Start Without Debugging" option or
pressing the "ctrl+F5" buttons

** If you are using an older/newer version of Visual studio you can
adjust the project and its tools to the version you are in by
right-clicking on the "ImageProcessing" solution->Properties, in the options
Configuration Properties->General change the options "Platform Toolset" and
".Net Target Framework Version" to the versions supported by Visual Studio
that you have installed.

3) To run without Visual studio simply navigate to the "x64/Release" folder and
double-click on "ImageProcessing.exe" (with this option it is not possible
